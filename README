my own PKGBUILD for the `coreutils-hybrid` package found in the AUR 

added the following rust uutils to the original PKGBUILD:
• date
• tail
• ls
• ln

removed the following rust uutils from the original PKGBUILD:
• tr (for password generation in 𝚙𝚊𝚜𝚜)


I've also decided to use the GNU coreutils 9.4 package and the rust uutils 0.0.24 package
